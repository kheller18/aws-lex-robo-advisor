# AWS Lex Robo Advisor

![license badge](https://shields.io/badge/license-GNU-blue)


## Description

This project uses AWS Lex and Lambda. I created a Lex Bot that will give recommendations to a user based on their inputs. The Lex Bot uses Lambda to check against constraints.

The general criteria for the bot is seen below:
  + Bot name: RoboAdvisor
  + Language: English (US)
  + Output voice: Salli
  + Session timeout: 5 Minutes
  + Sentiment analysis: No
  + COPPA: No
  + Advanced Options: No
  + All other options: Default values

Our intents are defined below:
  + Utterances
    + I want to save money for my retirement
    + I'm {age} and I would like to invest for my retirement
    + I'm â€‹{age} and I want to invest for my retirement
    + I want the best option to invest for my retirement
    + I'm worried about my retirement
    + I want to invest for my retirement
    + I would like to invest for my retirement

  + Slots
    + firstName (AMAZON.US_FIRST_NAME)
    + age (AMAZON.NUMBER)
    + investmentAmount (AMAZON.NUMBER)
    + riskLevel (AMAZON.AlphaNumeric)

Once everything has been defined, we can test our bot using only Lex. The GIF is seen below:

Now that we've seen that the bot works, we have to use Lambda to control our constraints. The constraints are as follows:
  + 0 >= age <=65
  + investmentAmount >= 5000

With the Lamda function tested and complete, we integrate it into Lex. We can see the new Lex GIF below:
